HystTau2      - Compute quasi-steady flow separation point and corresponding
                lift coefficient (Section 12.5)


Note:
The test case pertaining to quasi-steady stall modeling discussed in
Section 12.6.1 pertaining to ATTAS test aircraft, denoted by the flag
test_case = 27, is analyzed applying the output error method.
Accordingly, it is run from the directory /FVSysID2/chapter04/ by
setting test_case=27 and running the program ml_oem2.
